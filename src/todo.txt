//DONE ------------------
data refreshing in individual countdown clocks causes repaint/refresh of entire module

why first station doesn't have departures?

how to re-render favorite button in flatlist of countdownclocks

back end caching

offline support - what level to put "saveState action"
option 1: baked into every fetch
  *what happens on startup with parallel fetches? - could end up overwriting eachother
    *sol: have separate states for weather and schedule
option 2: manually call 
  *not as clean
if network error - shows up instead of offline data 

add user settings to asyncstorage + startupfetch
scaling - need to use flexbox to make everything fit - will have to make home page scrollview 

animation: 
  -countdown clock opening
  -countdown clock favoriting

screens flickering on tab change 
  -safe area view from react native flickers,
  -fix: use safeareaview from react navigation

what if user moved ? 
  -fix: new state: location last updated

null is not an object - getState.user.location.lat 
  - possibly because not calling locateUser if user enables location services after startup
  -fix: if user.location = null || it's been more than 5 minutes, fetch location before fetching data
bug: location denied -> no nearby stations -> enable -> can't display nearby sts
  -fix: add getnearby stations to schedule fetch
